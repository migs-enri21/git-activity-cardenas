# Git Activity

**Name:** Miguel Enrico Cardenas  
**Course/Year:** BSIT 3rd Year

### What I Learned:
From this activity, I learned how Git helps track code changes using version control, and how GitHub acts as an online platform to store and share repositories for collaboration. Using commands like `git add`, `commit`, and `push`, I can now synchronize my local work with a remote repository. This workflow makes teamwork more organized, and safer from data loss.
